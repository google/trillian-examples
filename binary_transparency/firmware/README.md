Firmware Transparency
=====================

This directory contains a description of how to apply transparency patterns and
principles to the problem of firmware updates.  In particular it will focus on
making firmware updates for a small compute platform discoverable.

See below for implementation status.

Background
----------

**Firmware is ubiquitous**; it's in your phone, watch, TV, alarm clock, baby
monitor, WiFi devices, possibly even your lightbulbs if you have LED lamps. In
any given desktop PC there's the BIOS/UEFI type firmware that many people are
familiar with, but there are also scores of other hidden firmware _blobs_
running on small controllers which power things like management engines,
keyboards, network cards, hard-disks/SSDs. The list goes on.

**Firmware is powerful**, it runs at the highest privilege level possible and
is often the bedrock on which the security story of the devices it powers
depends.

It is also often almost entirely invisible and inscrutable, and in many cases
has been
[shown to be insecure and vulnerable](https://eclypsium.com/2020/2/18/unsigned-peripheral-firmware).

Today, the best-in-class vendors who supply the firmware also provide an update
framework which verifies the integrity and authenticity of firmware updates
before allowing them to be installed.

Even in this _best case_, how do we know that the signed firmware is not
faulty, or even malicious?  What if the signing identity used to assert
authenticity if the firmware is somehow used to sign unintended updates
(whether through outright compromise as in the
[Realtek identity used to sign the Stuxnet worm](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/11/evasive-code-signed-malware-flourished-before-stuxnet-and-still-does/),
or, perhaps, more subtly via some form of insider risk - be it malicious or
otherwise)?

How will the _publisher themselves_ even know this has happened?  If they have
been compromised, can they trust their key protection or audit logging?

How will the consumer of the update know whether they're being given the same
update as all the other devices, or one especially crafted for just a small
subset of folks?

Firmware Transparency and Discoverability
-----------------------------------------

Firware Transparency is a mechanism to ensure that all firmware is
_discoverable_.
This means that the _same list_ of published firmware is visible to the
publisher, the devices which will be updated, and to folks like security
researchers who can use state-of-the-art static analysis and inspection tooling
to analyse them.

### Outline

> :warning: **This is work-in-progress and liable to change!**

The goal is to have a system where firmware updates can not be {installed/booted}
unless they have been made discoverable through being logged.


 - [X] Define a [claimant model](https://github.com/google/trillian/tree/master/docs/claimantmodel)
       description: [FT Claimant Model](./docs/design/README.md#claimant-model)
 - [ ] Specify/document a system architecture for that model.
 - [X] Come up with some metadata format: [FirmwareMetadata](./api/firmware_metadata.go)
 - [X] Build a simple personality around that format.
 - [ ] Extend personality to also store firmware images.
 - [x] Build a simple tool to create metadata given a "boot" image (e.g. Linux
     Kernel, WASM binary, etc.), and log it via the personality.
 - [x] Figure out a way to package the metadata with the bootable image.
 - [X] Build a noddy "device" emulator which enforces logging requirements, and refuses to boot
       an image unless all of the following are true:
    - [X] the metadata is present.
    - [ ] the metadata has a "valid" signature (perhaps using the "LOL! Sig"
          scheme).
    - [X] the boot-image hash matches the one committed do in the metadata.
    - [X] a valid STH and inclusion proof for the metatdata is available and
          verifies correctly.
 - [X] Build a simple "flash" tool which refuses to flash an image to a device
       unless all of the boot-time requirements above are satisfied, in
       addition to requesting and validating a valid consistency proof between
       the previously seen STH and the new STH.
 - [x] Flash stores "proof bundle" on device for validation at boot time.
 - [x] Build simple monitor to tail the log and dump info from meta-data in realtime.
 - [ ] Monitor is extended to validate firmware images hash

Planned future enhancements:
 - [ ] Integrate STH Witness support.
 - [ ] Add support for emulated and real hardware, e.g. via QEmu.

Running the Demo
----------------
Prerequisites:
* Install Docker and docker-compose
* Install Go (1.15+)
* Checkout:
  * This repo (FT)
  * [Trillian](https://github.com/google/trillian)

#### Terminal 1 - Trillian:
* Open terminal in root of `trillian` git repo, run:

```bash
export MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -hex 16)"
docker-compose -f examples/deployment/docker-compose.yml up trillian-log-server trillian-log-signer
```

#### Terminal 3 - Provision Log Tree:
* Run the following command to create a new tree inside Trillian, this only needs to be done once:

```bash
go run github.com/google/trillian/cmd/createtree --admin_server=localhost:8090
```

Record the tree ID that is returned by the command above, it will be referred to
as $TREE_ID by subsequent commands:

#### Terminal 2 - FT Personality:
* Open terminal in root of `firmware-transparency-demo` git repo, run:

```bash
go run ./cmd/ft_personality/main.go --logtostderr -v=2 --tree_id=$TREE_ID --cas_db_file=/path/to/ft.db
```

The `cas_db_file` needs to be available for the duration of this log, so writing to `/tmp/` is considered risky.

#### Terminal 3
Open terminal in root of `firmware-transparency-demo` git repo for the following steps:

1. Add Something

   We're going to log a new "firmware" build.

   Open terminal in root of `firmware-transparency-demo` git repo, run:

   ```bash
   go run cmd/publisher/publish.go --logtostderr --v=2 --timestamp="2020-10-10T15:30:20.10Z" --binary_path=./testdata/firmware/dummy_device/example.wasm --output_path=/tmp/update.ota
   ```

   This creates and logs a new firmware manifest to the log, waits for it to be
   included, and then builds an firmware update package ("OTA") and writes it out to local disk.

2. "Flash" a device with the new firmware.

   Now that we have an update package for our new firmware, we can try flashing
   it to a device. The repo contains a "dummy device" which uses the local disk
   to store the device's state.

   We'll use the `cmd/flash_tool` to do this flashing.

   > :warning: Note that the first time you do this the "dummy device" will
   > have no state and the flashing process will fail.
   > It will also fail if you've previously flashed firmware onto the device
   > from a different log.
   > In both of these cases, you can use the `--force` flag on the `flash_tool`.

   ```bash
   go run ./cmd/flash_tool/ --logtostderr --update_file=/tmp/update.ota --dummy_storage_dir=/tmp/dummy_device  # --force if it's the first time
   ```

3. Boot the device.

   We'll boot the device emulator to check that everything is working ok.
   The "ROM" on the dummy device verifies the integrity of the firmware and
   proofs stored on the device.

    ```bash
    go run ./cmd/devices/dummy_emu --logtostderr --dummy_storage_dir=/tmp/dummy_device
    ```

4. Now we've seen it works, let's try to hack it!
