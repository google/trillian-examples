Binary Transparency
===================

The software supply chain has many areas where an increase in _discoverability_
of artifacts and the claims which surround them can help improve the security
and trust in the output of those chains.

Applying the transparency models, patterns, and techniques is a good way to
achieve this discoverability.

This directory will contain some examples of how to apply binary transparency
to particular use cases.

 * [Firmware Transparency](firmware)
    This is an example of applying transparency to firmware for a small compute
    platform.
    You can imagine this in the context of phones, or IoT devices etc., but the
    same principles apply for larger systems such as compute servers etc., too.
