# Serverless Log on GCP
This directory contains another example implementation of a log represented by tiles and files, using components from the Trillian repo (e.g. compact ranges) and GCP infrastructure. It demonstrates the usage of [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions) to process and integrate new log entries and the usage of [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) as the storage for tiles and files.

## Overview
We deploy two functions to GCF:
1. `integrate`: with the `--initialise` flag, creates a bucket which acts as our log storage layer. Without it, integrates sequenced log entries to the tree by updating the tiles and checkpoint files.
1. `sequence`: assigns leaf index numbers to each new log entry, preparing it for integration to the tree.

Both functions are HTTP-triggered and run when their respective endpoints are requested.

## Deployment
### Pre-reqs:
1.  Create a GCP project. [Enable](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi/enable-api) GCF and GCS APIs.

### GCF function deployment:
1.  Generate a set of public and private keys following
    [these](https://github.com/google/trillian-examples/tree/master/serverless#generating-keys)
    instructions and set them as the `PUBLIC_KEY` and `PRIVATE_KEY`.
1. Set `PROJECT_NAME` as the name of your GCP project (string, not number).
1.  Deploy the Integrate function:
    ```
    gcloud functions deploy integrate \
    --entry-point Integrate \
    --runtime go116 \
    --trigger-http \
    --set-env-vars "GCP_PROJECT=${PROJECT_NAME},SERVERLESS_LOG_PUBLIC_KEY=${PUBLIC_KEY},SERVERLESS_LOG_PRIVATE_KEY=${PRIVATE_KEY}" \
    --source=./serverless/experimental/gcp-log \
    --max-instances 1
    ```
1.  Deploy the Sequence function:
    ```
    gcloud functions deploy sequence \
    --entry-point Sequence \
    --runtime go116 \
    --trigger-http \
    --set-env-vars "GCP_PROJECT=${PROJECT_NAME},SERVERLESS_LOG_PUBLIC_KEY=${PUBLIC_KEY}" \
    --source=./serverless/experimental/gcp-log \
    --max-instances 1
    ```
