// dummy_emu is an "emulator" for the dummy device.
//
// This emulator shows how the firmware transparency artifacts stored
// when firmware is updates are validated on boot to protect the device against
// tampering.
//
// The device's initialisation routines in "ROM" are where this validation
// takes place, and the device only "jumps into" the firmware payload once
// successful validation has taken place.
//
// Usage:
//
//	go run ./cmd/emulator/dummy --logtostderr --dummy_storage_dir=/tmp/dummy_device
