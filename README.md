This repository contains example applications built on top of
[Trillian][], showing that it's possible to apply
Transparency concepts to problems other than
[Certificates](https://github.com/google/certificate-transparency-go).

Currently the examples here are:
 * [binary_transparency/firmware](binary_transparency/firmware): A demo
   showing how to apply transparency bring discoverability to device firmware
   updates, but the principles are also more generally applicable to all kinds
   of binaries/updates.

 * [tritter](tritter): An example / demo of a chat service with audit
   capability.

 * [sumdbaudit](sumdbaudit): Demonstration of an auditor for the
   [GoLang SumDB](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/25530-sumdb.md)
   module proxy, which clones a log and verifies the data in it.

These examples are not supported per-se, but the Trillian team will likely try
to help where possible.  You can contact them via the channels listed under
*Support* on the [Trillian][] repo.
