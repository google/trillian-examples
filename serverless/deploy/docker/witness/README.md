Witness
-------

This [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) file can be used to spin up a witness daemon.

## GitHub access

You'll need to create a GitHub
[Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
for the feeder to use to create a PR on the log repo with the witnessed checkpoint.

**Important:**
When you create this token, tick **only** the `public_repo` checkbox - this witness does not need
any extra priviledges beyond this basic level of authorization.

## Configuration and running

You should set the following environmemt variables (either `export` or with a `.env` file):

Variable Name                   | Required | Description
--------------------------------|:--------:|-------------------------------------------------
`SERVERLESS_DISTRIBUTOR_REPO`   | yes      | The GitHub "<owner/repo>" fragment of the serverless distributor
`SERVERLESS_DISTRIBUTOR_FORK`   | yes      | The GitHub "<owner/repo>" fragment of the witness' fork of the serverless distributor
`SERVERLESS_DISTRIBUTOR_DIR`    | yes      | The path to the root of the serverless distributor in its repo
`SERVERLESS_DISTRIBUTOR_BRANCH` | no       | The main branch of the serverless distributor repo
`FEEDER_DISTRIBUTOR_CONFIG_DIR` | yes      | The path to the directory containing the shared `feeder` and `distribute` commands' config file
`FEEDER_DISTRIBUTOR_CONFIG_FILE`| yes      | The name of the shared `feeder` and `distrubute` commands' config file in `${FEEDER_DISTRIBUTOR_CONFIG_DIR}`
`DISTRIBUTOR_GITHUB_TOKEN`      | yes      | A GitHub [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) for the `distribute` command to use to create a PR on the distributor repo with the witnessed checkpoint
`GIT_USERNAME`                  | yes      | The GitHub username associated with the Personal Access Token
`GIT_EMAIL`                     | yes      | An email address to associate with the feeder commits
`WITNESS_PRIVATE_KEY`           | yes      | The witness private key in note format (*not* the path to the key)
`WITNESS_CONFIG_DIR`            | no       | Absolute path to a directory containing a witness config file (default: `/etc/witness/config`)
`WITNESS_CONFIG_FILE`           | no       | The name of the witness config file within `${WITNESS_CONFIG_DIR}` (default: `witness.config`)
`INTERVAL_SECONDS`              | no       | The number of seconds between feed/witness/distribute attempts, set to empty string for one-shot (default: 300s)

With the env variables configured, the witness can be started with the following command:

```bash
$ docker-compose -f serverless/deploy/docker/witness/docker-compose.yaml up
Starting witness_witness_1 ... done
Attaching to witness_witness_1
witness_1  | I0714 18:20:19.300495       1 witness.go:88] Connecting to local DB at "/data/witness.sqlite"
witness_1  | I0714 18:20:19.301276       1 witness.go:108] Starting witness server...
```

> ```

## Pushing to multiple distributors

You'll likely want to make your witnessed checkpoints available via multiple
distributors for redundancy/resiliance.

You can achieve this by modifying the `docker-compose.yaml` file to have multiple
`distributor` containers (one per distributor), and adding/renaming the
`SERVERLESS_DISTRIBUTOR_*` environment variables in both the `docker-compose.yaml`
and `.env` files so that each distributor container is properly configured.
