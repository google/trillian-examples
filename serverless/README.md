Serverless Log
===============

Most of the contents of this directory has graduated to its own repo at
<https://github.com/transparency-dev/serverless-log>.

The remaining parts are:
[clone2serverless](./cmd/clone2serverless): A tool for dumping transparency
logs cloned with the [clone](/clone) tools into a locally hosted serverless
log.

serverless distributor: This has been deleted as it's superseded by the
[REST distributor](https://github.com/transparency-dev/distributor).
